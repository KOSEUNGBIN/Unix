In the middle of a traffic jam on a highway, snack vendors holding bags of puffed rice snacks weave through vehicles that stand bumper to bumper.

This scene is familiar to many in South Korea with the experience of being stuck on a congested highway on weekends or major holidays.

“When I was younger, it took some 10 hours to go to Mokpo where my grandparents live during the holidays. We were stuck on the clogged road for hours, moving at the speed of tortoises,” said Lee Jin-hee, a 35-year-old office worker.

“The Bbeongtuigi (puffed rice snack) sellers would walk around on the middle of the highway, and I would nag at my parents to buy me snacks. This scene would be repeated every year on holidays and it became my childhood memory.”

Although not as often as in the past, these puffed rice snack sellers still pop up on jammed roads or highways, prompting many to wonder: Why do they always sell puffed rice snacks and where do these people come from?

A wholesaler explained to The Korea Herald that it is because such snacks are cheap and easy to bring around due to their light weight. The traditional snack also recalls the nostalgia of old days.
